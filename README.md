# Recursive-Functions
Recursive functions. 

1. Prime(n) that returns true for a prime number and false for the other? 
For example prime(5) should return true and prime(8) should return false.


2. PrimeSeq(n) that prints all 	prime number which less than n?
For example prime(10) should print 2,3,5, and 7 on the terminal.


3. Returns the addition of numbers from1 to n?
For example sum(5) should print 15


4. Determine even and odd numbers? 


5. Get the addition of all even numbers less than given n.


6. Print first n Fibonacci numbers for given n.
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . 
Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
